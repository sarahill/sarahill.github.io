        <p class="lh-copy">
          When Tracker first hit the scene 10 years ago, it was seen as one of the leaders amongst
          product management tools. Over time, more and more tools that solve similar problems in varying ways
          have started to pop up. Recently, there seems to be a new product management app popping up weekly.

        <p class="mt4 lh-copy">
          The team started wondering "How can we build quicker?". As the team started to
          tackle bigger themes that required more extensive design and development work communication
          and consistency started to break down. As a result, we introduced the Pivotal Tracker Styleguide.

        <p class="mt4 lh-copy">
          Over the past year the Styleguide has evolved from a living guide made up of html and css based components
          to a pattern library with both react and elm components from the main app's codebase. To continue to build
          out the library, the team has chores in their development backlogs to continue to add to and update
          the pattern library.

        <h3 class="mb0">Designing with components</h3>
        <p class="lh-copy">
          To continue to bridge the gap between development and design, we created a Sketch UI Kit that is
          composed of Sketch symbols built to mirror the components found in the Pattern Library. Having these
          sets of tools starts to bring us closer to speaking the same language and thinking about the pieces
          of the UI in a similar way.

          The Tracker Design and Development teams are continuing to refine the process of maintaing and scaling
          the Design System. As we continue to tackle some bigger user problems, we continue to think about the best
          user experience and the best way to capture that in the code.
