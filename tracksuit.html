        <p class="lh-copy">
          Pivotal Tracker has experienced a lot of growth over the past few years. As the team continued
          to grow, it became clear that we needed a way to scale the design and development process. A one-off
          solution can sometimes be necessary, but if these solutions aren't built on top of a solid foundation,
          we eventually find ourselves with a lot of design and technical debt.
        </p>
        <p class="mt4 lh-copy">
          I started to think about how we could unify our language across product and development. So, for a
          hackday project I worked on building a styleguide that housed HTML and CSS based components with documentation
          around how to use them. The styleguide is built on the <a href="#">Hologram</a> framework. Hologram makes it easy to
          write and maintain documentation with markdown.
        </p>

        <p class="mt4 lh-copy">
          The styleguide started to evolve into a pattern library of react based components. The goal was
          to make it easy for anyone to be able to see what components are actually being used in production as opposed
          to be it just being a source of reference.

        <h3 class="mb0">Designing with components</h3>
        <p class="lh-copy">
          To continue to bridge the gap between development and design, we created a Sketch UI Kit that is
          composed of Sketch symbols built to mirror the components found in the Pattern Library. Having these
          sets of tools starts to bring us closer to speaking the same language and thinking about the pieces
          of the UI in a similar way.

        <p class="lh-copy">
          The Tracker Design and Development teams are continuing to refine the process of maintaing and scaling
          the Design System. As we continue to tackle some bigger user problems, we continue to think about the best
          user experience and the best way to capture that in the code.
