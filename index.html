    </br>
    I have a strong passion for UI and UX design, exploring new ideas, new technologies, and innovation. When I'm not creating online software you can find me outside enjoying the beauty of Colorado, tackling a trail run, or enjoying a local brew. On weekends I go for a carefree frolic in the park while humming popular hits from the 80s, 90s, and today.
