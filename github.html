        <h3 class="mb0 black-60">Overview</h3>
        <p class="lh-copy black-80">Pivotal Tracker is an agile product management
          tool that helps small cross-functional teams stay on top of their work
          and deliver more frequently and consistently.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-copy black-80">We have been working on a new way to surface
          developer code within Tracker. We have a current GitHub integration
          that is managed through service hooks on the GitHub side and allows
          users to push commits to any Tracker story as long as they include the
          story ID in the commit title. We were realizing though that this wasnâ€™t
          meeting customer needs.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="mt5">
        <h3 class="mb0 black-60">Uncovering Opportunities</h3>
        <p class="lh-copy black-80">We were getting a lot of feedback from our
          users that they needed better insight into the status of their code for
          any given feature. We were hearing it from our customers and we were
          feeling the pain ourselves.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-copy black-80">To uncover what our customers needed from a
          GitHub integration, one of the product managers and I started talking
          to them. We wanted to know how developers were working inside of
          Tracker and how we could improve the code-to-story experience.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-copy black-80">Through talking to customers, we found that
          a lot of users that weren't using the current GitHub integration didn't actually
          know it existed, and the ones that were using it didn't get much value out
          of just seeing commits. Commits can be frequent and have the potential to
          clutter up an already long activity stream.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-copy black-80">We also learned that it wasn't just developers that
          cared about what state the code was in. Testers, PMs, and anyone else
          responsible for any part of a story's delivery and acceptance, wanted to
          know when checks for a branch or PR passed. This was a signal that the story
          was ready for the next step.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="mt5">
        <h3 class="mb0 black-60">Exploration</h3>
        <p class="lh-copy black-80">I started to get familiar with GitHub, GitLab,
          and BitBucket to get an understanding of how the platforms compared. Our focus
          was GitHub to start, but we would eventually scale to support other code managment
          platforms.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-copy black-80">Once I had this information, I started putting ideas on
          paper. I sketched out several ideas and shared them with the team. Next, I started
          to create concepts in Sketch. I explored concepts
          around introducing pull requests and branches and surfacing the status of build
          checks for each. I worked closely with the developers throughout the process to
          get feedback from a technical perspective.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-copy black-80">One thing I wasn't sure about was whether these new code
          bricks should remain in the story activity alongside commits or if they should
          be elevated.

      <p class="lh-copy black-80">As a first step, the team started building a pretty bare
        bones version of the pull request and branch cards as manual attachments.

        <p class="lh-copy black-80">Now we needed to make the GitHub integration,
          and integrations in general, more discoverable. We found that users would
          stumble upon
